# Infection-Simulation
This C++ program simulates the spread of a COVID like disease within a population of 100 people. 
This was our assignment 1 for CS112 (Data Structure and Algorithms), Semester 2, 2023.

# What I Learnt
- Structs and Classes
- Arrays of sturcts
- using functions on sturcts and its arrays

# NOTE
-This was the most difficult assignment and unit of the year. Therefore, code may not be of proper standards and requirments but it does the job ;)
